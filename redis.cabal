Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:
	Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced
	key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server
	since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,
	hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
    .	
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. It's tested with
    current git version and with v2.2.4 of redis server. It also
    tested with v2.0.5 and basic functions are works correctly but not
    all of them.
	.
	You can use Test module from the source package to run unit
	tests. Try /runhaskell Test.hs --help/ for usage info. Caution! Do not
	run tests on your working database - test database will be
	flushed.
	.
	There are simple benchmark module included: Benchmark.hs. It shows
	me about two times less requests per second than redis-benchmark
	from server distribution.
	.
	Please let me know if tests or benchmark goes terribly wrong.
	.
	Changes from v0.10:
	.
	- Simple optimisation of redis protocol replays parsing that leads to
	  significant speed improvement on get-like commands
    .
	- New commandline options for test runner (see above)
	.
	- Simple benchmark included (see above)
	.
	- New commands implemented: brpoplpush (blocking rpoplpush),
      getrange, setrange, getbit and setbit
	.
	- getType reply is now parsed into RedisKeyType datatype instead
      of just returning Reply. Warning! It's backward incompatible!
	.
	- info reply is now parsed into Map String String. Warning! It's
      backward incompatible!
	.
